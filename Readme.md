# Reactivity on vanilla Js

After listen a video [**Radical Simplicity**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xh-iMBOXl6M) on Youtube, I rethink the complexity of the current technologies, I think there were many new libraries when is not clear solution with current technologies, for example. I was using libraries to set up service worker on a project on nextJS, but I after understand the life cycle of service worker and NextJS, I've been able to set up my service worker without libraries, I think the same happen with many technologies.

So Im thinking if is possible to implement web application with **only required** technologies + awesome engineering

> Why ðŸ¤”? less is more, less technologies to learn more deeper knowledge and efficient engineering to build awesome products

I aim to have a stack in frontend with: vanilla JS + Typescript + Tailwind + Vite

- reactivity = events + reducer
